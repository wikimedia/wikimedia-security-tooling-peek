* Actions
** T253901: Automate ticket removal from "Watching" column on the #Security-team Phabricator workboard after a certain timeframe

* Anti Patterns
** Abstract anti-patterns out to work dynamically off
  of backend status method anti_**
** tasks assigned to members without team tag (security-team)
** assigned items in backlog
** tasks with mutually exclusive tags

* Features
** Better value override for extended configs.  Should allow sub params to override instead
   of copying entire stanzas.
** Charts in the email
** Clean up the template (esp html)
** Tasks processed by project, esp for phab should include those modified
  with the tag within duration and not only created.
** Use base class for backends
** Reporting on most commonly associatd tags (-security)
** Reporting on submitter and group
** make options help more useful
** expand antipatterns to task link (info all there)
** Attack yaml?  Would have to careful of leaking things
  from sensitive projects and backends but the main motivation
  is to facilitate longer term historical lookbacks. Maybe
  this being a webapp is the better option.  IDK.  Aggregate
  stats seem OK here.

* Prospective
** ignore assigned tasks with epic tag as they should not
  themselves contain actual "work"?  This could make task
  assignment metrics more meaningful but the use of 'epic'
  would need to be consistent.
** Programmitic input from mailing lists about volume etc?
** Subtract watching tasks from open count?
